# credit-risk-classification-challenge
Module 20 Credit Risk Classification by Mwohania (Nia) Taylor

Repo for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp

In this challenge, we were asked to use scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model to attempt to fit and predict credit risk of loans, and check the accuracy of the model's predictions. This was done once for sample training/testing data, and once for the randomly oversampled dataset, to compare the effects of removing the imbalanced data.

The report markdown file contains a description of the steps taken as well as an analysis of which model was more successful for the purpose of the challenge.
