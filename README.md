# credit-risk-classification-challenge
Module 20 Credit Risk Classification by Mwohania (Nia) Taylor

Repo for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp

In this challenge, we were asked to use scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model to attempt to fit and predict credit risk of loans, and check the accuracy of the model's predictions. To compare the effects of imbalanced data we used sample training/testing data and the randomly oversampled dataset.
